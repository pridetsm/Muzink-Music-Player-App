# Muzink-Music-Player-App
This app is my first android application.it is a music player app which demonstrates how to implement 
a music player service as well as all the best practices to follow when using the MVVM architecture style
it will run on all versions of androids from Marshmallow.
The app displays a list of all the songs in one of the fragments in an Viewpager, While one of the 
other fragments contains albums from which the songs belong.Nested fragments were used for navigation in the app.
The other two fragments although not yet complete are meant to contain playlists and the main player fragment.
Currently the app works finem however one can only play a song from the albums fragment.
